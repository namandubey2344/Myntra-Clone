   - Display product thumbnails with names, prices, and quick view options.
   - Implement sorting and filtering options (by price, size, color, etc.).

3. **Product Detail Page**
   - Show detailed product information (name, images, description, price).
   - Include options for selecting size, color, quantity.
   - Add to cart and wishlist functionalities.

4. **Cart and Checkout**

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure the content of web pages.
- **CSS**: Style the layout and appearance of elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implement interactivity, dynamic content loading (e.g., AJAX for fetching products), and form validations.
- **Backend Integration**: Depending on the project scope, you might use a backend language (like Node.js, Python with Django/Flask, etc.) to handle user authentication, database operations, and API integrations (e.g., for fetching product data).

### Additional Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize images and code for faster loading times.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Security**: Implement secure authentication practices and protect sensitive user data.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

### Conclusion

Building a Myntra clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a challenging but rewarding project that allows you to apply frontend development skills to create a functional and visually appealing e-commerce website.
